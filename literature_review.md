Similarly,there is a website called W3school that provides tutorials, examples and references for various technologies with an online editor that enables users to experiment with code samples and view the outcomes in real-time.
It is a user-friendly approach of learning,easy to follow with comprehensive content. The website's style is user-friendly, and its tutorials are divided into small sections, making it simple for users to comprehend even difficult subjects.W3Schools also has a community forum where users may post queries, share information, and get help from other developers. A wide number of web technologies are also covered by W3Schools, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, SQL, and others.
Although W3Schools is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning web development , some developers criticize it for being too simplistic and not covering some advanced topic. Another limitation is that W3Schools doesn't offer formal certification for its courses, so users may not have a recognized qualification to show for their learning. Additionally, it doesn't effectively monitor student achievement, and neither does it provide support for students or an assessment of their development.
Shortcoming these limitations, our product ‘Lab Management System’ stays up-to-date on the latest trends and best practices by following blogs,Books and news sources.As we collaborate with teachers and colleges / universities there LMS effectively monitors student achievement, and provides support for students and assists them by reviewing their work up to date.
